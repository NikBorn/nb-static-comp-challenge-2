# nb-static-comp-challenge-2  

## I started by splitting the comp into two articles, a header section and lower body section.  I began the project with mobile first and worked up.  Initally I got the layout of
one of the cards before adding the rest.  I used percentages where I thought it was appropriate and did not use view height and view 
width, as I have on past projects.
